Objectives
	The goal of the miners is to explore all the tunnels in their cave system.
The cave system has many rooms, each with its puzzle to solve. The miners can solve the puzzles and with
the solutions, the wizards can break the magic barriers protecting the cave and gain access to the adjacent
rooms.
	The Wizards are not always available, as sometimes they sleep. When a wizard is awake, he takes puzzle
solutions from the miners, and does wizardly things to unlock the paths to all adjacent rooms.  If the puzzles
are solved incorrectly, when the wizard tries to unlock the paths, a great explosion kills everyone, ends the
program.
	To solve a puzzle the miner starts calculating the hash of the hash of the hash
of ...  of the hash of the string. The number of times to repeat the hash operation is fixed and equal to N.
The miners start outside of the cave, and they know in which room to go by getting this information from
the wizards. When this happens, the wizards also tell the miners what the string that needs to be hashed is.

The cave system
	The cave system contains many rooms. There are multiple cave entrances and all of them can be accessed at
the start. There is no guarantee that any room can be reached from any other room using the cave system.
However, there is a guarantee that all rooms can be reached if all entrances are used.
Each room is protected by magic that needs to be taken down by the wizard. Once a room is unlocked, the
adjacent, undiscovered rooms are revealed.

	When the wizard is awake, he takes a puzzle solution along with the name of the current room as well as
the name of the previous room, and unlocks the current room.  An incorrectly solved puzzle will trigger the
explosion. Once a barrier is down the wizard gives the list of adjacent rooms to the miners, so they can start
work on the next puzzles.

The communication channel
	The  miners  and  the  wizards  communicate  using  a  communication  channel.   For  every  puzzle  solved,  the
miners  give  the  wizards  the  following  information  in  a  single  message:  the  room  name,  the  name  of  the
previous room (the parent room) and the solution of the puzzle.
	For  every  puzzle  solution,  the  wizards  give  the  miners  the  list  of  rooms  adjacent  to  the  room  in  which
the puzzle was solved.  It the wizards get an incorrect solution or incorrect previous room, an explosion is
triggered.
	When there are no more rooms, the wizards put EXIT messages in the communication channel, one for each
miner.  They also trigger the end of the program.

I. ComunicationChannel
	In implementarea mea am definit in clasa CommunicationChannel:
	-2 LinkedBlockingQueue pentru coada de mesaje ce urmeaza sa fie preluate de
catre miner sau wizard.
	-1 ConcurrentHashMap in care se adauga camerele care au fost trimise deja
in coada de mesaje pentru mineri. Acest hashmap este folosit pentru a verifica
existenta duplicatelor in mesajele trimise de catre vrajitori. Inainte de a
trimite un mesaj cu informatiile camerei ce urmeaza sa fie minat verifica
existenta acesteia in hashmap. Daca nu s-a gasit o adauga in hashmap si apoi
trimite mesajul.
	-1 Hashmap in care cheia este id-ul vrajitorului si valoare lista de mesaje
pe care vrajitorul a trimis-o pana la mesajul "END". La trimiterea mesajului
"END" mesajele trimise de vrajitor sunt extrase din coada doua cate doua pana
cand lista este goala. Fiecare pereche de mesaje: camera-parinte/camera-copil
vor fii verificate cu ajutorul ConcurrentHashMap-ului de mai sus si apoi
trimise sub forma unui singur mesaj.
II. Miner
	Deoarece toate problemele de concurenta si parsare a mesajelor au fost
rezolvate in CommunicationChannel, minerii doar vor verifica daca vrajitorii au
mesaje, mineaza mesajul, apoi trimit raspunsul inapoi la vrajitor prin
intermediul canalului de comunicatie.
